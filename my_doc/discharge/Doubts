- Difference distance of the plate. See graph. 
- DIfference way to define breakdown voltage: Sufficient ion density. 
statt 1e4 to 1e11 (cm 1e-3)


SIMULATION ( No change everything together) 
- Try with different distance plate? 
- dt always equal. more conservative. (or Different factor of reduction)
- Maybe secondary electron emission coefficient also smaller.
