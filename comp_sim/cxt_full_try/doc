This one is the basic of the complete simulation. For now I'm getting the domain fixed to use the restart file form the neutral simulation. 
It would be nice to choose the best simulation for the nutrals put it here and reiterate again in this simulation now.

- Domain: 30 mm x 5 mm

- Flux of electrons: (PARAMETER)

- Orifice: 2 mm (along the axis) 

- Voltage:  (PARAMETER)

- spwt e- = 

- spwt ions =
