DIFF INTERACTIONS: 

- Starting from the basic simulation, there will be an evaluation of the impact of the different interactions used: 


cxtn1 : Only diffusion 
cxtn2 : Diffusion (0.6), Cosine (0.2), Specular(0.2)

No significant differences are expected. Plus there is the example of DSMC where only diffusion model is used. That should be the one. 

For DSMC that model is the best. BSS ALPHA does not change that much. It could be veriefied in a future work, but you can still consider the example of Breida. 


OUTCOME:
