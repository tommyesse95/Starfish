cxnt1_base represents the basic for all the other simulations. 
In each folder There a specific parameter will change to see the result. 
At the end the file restart bin will be used in the other folder: "Complete_sim" and we will see the ideal configuration. 

dif_inl : Different position of the neutral inlet. 
dif_inter : Different interaction
dif_spwt : Different specific weight 
dif_time_sim : Different time simulatED

See in each folder for realtice documentation



OBJECTIVE: Simulation with only neutral gas. Used to take the restart bin file and use it in cxt1 for ionization! 

BASIC: 
 
- 30 mm x 5 mm.  

- mdot = 1e-5 

- Density (average) expected: 1e22.

- Pd = 0.8 (Discharge should be reached)

- Particles: 1e16 (spwt = 1e12) --> 1e4 simulated

- dt =1e-8 / num_it = 1e5 / time_simulated = 1e-3 s 

- Interactions: diffusion (p=0.8) / specular(p=0.2) / DSMC / no cosine model
