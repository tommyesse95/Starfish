DIFFERENT TIME SIMULATED 


Here we increase the number of iterations to see if the steady state is actually reached and if it changes a lot regarding the density profile. 

cxtn1: 1e4
cxtn2: 1e5 (BASIC, we change the dt to 1e-9, obtaining the same time simulated of cxtn1 to see if something change)
cxtn3: 1e6
cxtn4: 1e7
