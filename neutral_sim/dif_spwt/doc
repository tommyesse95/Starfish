DIFF SPECIFIC WEIGHT

Here there will be evaluated the different computational time depending on the actual number of particles simulated. 

The basic is considered 1e12 that should give an order of 1e4 particles actually simulated considering the number of particles expected at the steady state. 

SET-UP: 

cxtn1: 1e10
cxtn2: 1e11
cxtn3: 1e12 (BASIC SIMULATION)
cxtn4: 1e13
